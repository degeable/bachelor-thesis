# bachelor-thesis

This repo contains the Qt project of my bachelor thesis.

The tools directory contains a python script to send compass data from the Matrix Creator.

To use the whole system, a raspberry pi and a matrix creator board is necessary. But you can use demo data.

Heres a quick demo video. Keep in mind that the visualization is a bit shaky due to the bad Matrix Creator compass data (smoothing function is disabled here to prevent delay).
